# Credit-Card-Fraud-Analysis
# Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud transactions. The analysis uses dataset of credit card transactions to identify patterns and anomalies that can help predict fraudulent activity.

# Data Source
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes the following variables:
1. Time(seconds)
2. Class
3. Amount (Euro)
4. V1 - V28
   
# Key Finding
1. Fraudulent transactions often exhibit unsual patterns, such as high-frequency transactions or transactions in multiple locations within a short time frame.
2. Fraudulent transactions often deviate from the cardholder normal behavior, at unsual times or in different locations.
3. fraudulent transactions often involve high amounts of transactions.
4. Changes in cardholder behaviour such as sudden change in spending habits or transaction frequency can indicate potential fraud.

# Tools used
Data Analysis (Microsoft Excel, SQL).
Data Visualization (PowerBi).

# Recommendation
1. Monitor cardholder behavior.
2. Develop an alert system to notify cardholders and financial institution of potential fraud.
3. Protect sensitive data.
4. Educate cardholders on how to protect themselves from credit card fraud.
5. Train staff on how to detect and respond to credit card fraud

# Conclusion
The analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting credit card fraud transactions. The developed model can be used to identify potential fraudulent activity and prevent financial losses.
